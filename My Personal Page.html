        <p>What's up? I'm Carl Bruce (as seen by the home page). I'm a 20 year old programming student from rural Jamaica, with not a lot of interesting things about him (in my own opinion). </p></font> <font size = 3.5><p>I enjoy a somewhat wide variety of activities. These include watching movies, watching TV shows, occasionally watching anime, watching live streams of either video games or someone else making music, playing video games, which sadly haffi stop because i'm getting assignments left and right, going to bed late, which as a result of me SADLY having classes at 8 A.M. almost every morning, haffi stop too, talking about music that I love with other people, and attempting to make some music in the little free time I have. Of course, seeing as I like music that much, I listen to music a lot too. I also had an interest in photography at a point in time......if you're interested in checking out the pictures I took, click <a href = "Creative%20Page.html"> here.</a> Some of my favorite TV shows in recent times have been <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>, <strong>Better Call Saul</strong>, and <strong>Barry</strong>. <s>It seems most TV shows starting with the letter B are better than the others.</s> <p>Some video games I play regularly include Fortnite, Brawlhalla, Need for Speed: The Run, and Grand Theft Auto IV. Playing Fortnite used to be a nightly thing for me, up until my internet decided that no fun is allowed in the house anymore. I used to also play Call of Duty a lot with friends in high school but it seems most of them grew out of that stage and partake in different activities. Some of my favorite animes, if you care enough about anime in general, have been Mob Psycho 100, The Disastrous Life of Saiki K, Death Note, and Bleach. As a result of not having any free time these days, and being impatient, I don't have any opportunities to watch new anime like I used to.</p><p><font size = 4.5><strong>Back to the topic of music! </strong></font>According to some of my friends, my music taste is "terrible", but that doesn't concern me because a my ears and not theirs, and my ears like the music I listen to. Really and truly I like any sort of music that just sounds good........I'm not sure how to describe it any better. Genres I like include hip-hop (because who doesn't like hip-hop), rock and metal, the many subgenres surrounding those, RnB, some electronic music, and dancehall (even though I don't listen to it as often as I should). Some of my favorite artistes include Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Yeat, Alice in Chains, Title Fight, Deftones, and the list goes <strong>on and on and on. </strong> Also, if you feel like being nice and checking out a "song" of mine, click the link <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/gemayca-572164076/descorrer-mayhem-beat-contest-entry" target="_blank"><font size = 4.5>here.</font></a> Nuh worry though, your ears are safe because I don't sing or use my voice or anything, I just make instrumentals as I've always been interested in how instruments work overall.</p> <p> Enough about my likes, time to get into my dislikes. Everybody loves talking about what they don't like! </p> <p> Really and truly there aren't a lot of things I dislike, only some slight grievances. I dislike people that are loud and obnoxious for no reason, or people whose default speaking voice is practically shouting......the easiest way to irritate me is to talk loudly when your point can be made in a normal tone of voice. I also dislike people that are heavily materialistic, I dislike mayonnaise (although I also don't mind it on some foods), and I dislike liars, as any sane person would.</p><p> I took the Similar Minds personality test to see what type of personality I have, and the results were surprisingly accurate:</p> <center><img src = ".//Assets/personality%20test.PNG" height = "700" width = "1800"></center> 
        <p>In my opinion, the Similar Minds test holds some general validity. In the screenshot above, it shows many different percentages of common personality traits of people in modern times. In my case, many of these perfectly describe who I am as a person. Let's take being easygoing for example. According to the Similar Minds test, being easygoing means being compelled to relax, take it easy, not to get worked up about most things, prefers peace and leisure, and dislikes conflict. I have never been the type of person to seek out problems with other people in my time on Earth, and I'll also jump at the first chance I get to relax as doing work 24/7 is honestly too much stress. Another example that I can agree with, regrettably, is with the borderline personality disorder observation. It says individuals with this disorder have issues regulating their emotions, and I've always had problems with my anger and getting irritated too easily. This test also says that I'm a type 9 personality, which consists of the healthy type: "The Stoic", the average type: "The Monk", and the unhealthy type: "The Slacker". Personally, I believe all 3 types apply to me perfectly; I always aim to put people around me at ease, i'm unpretentious, easy-going, and peaceful, but on the negative side, I can be lazy, passive, and sometimes overly compliant.  </p>

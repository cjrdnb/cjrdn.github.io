        <li><p>Open minded – I am a very open minded person, as I am willing to give many different things a try if I’m willing to experience it, and I don’t judge anything or anyone at first glance. </p><p>Over the past years, I’ve been working on this in order to be an even fairer individual to others around me, by not keeping my standard for approval too high so I can fully enjoy whatever it is that is presented to me.</p></li>
        <li><p> Optimistic – Being an optimist, I mainly think about the positives of whatever I’m doing, but I don’t always think this way, as pessimistic thoughts sometimes take over my mind. However, I try my best to keep positive even when situations look dismal.</p> <p>In recent times, I’ve been working on being a full-fledged optimist by shutting out any negative thought that comes to mind. I do this by only focusing on the benefits I’ll get in any situation rather than dwelling on if something will go wrong, and by reassuring myself that no matter how rough things look, I’ll come out on top.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sociable – With being sociable, I am a very friendly person; I won’t immediately disrespect you if you come up to me and start a conversation. However, I emanate a stand-offish vibe sometimes, which might discourage someone to talk to me or even think I’m an unfriendly person.</p> <p>In the last 5 years, I’ve been working on this, no matter how long it takes, by trying not to make my facial expression look like a scowl, and by talking more and in a brighter tone than I used to. </p></li>

    <p>In chapter 4, Michael and Charlie, 2 presumably close friends, arrange to get together and have a chat. Charlie asks Michael about work and his life, to which Michael responds saying he wishes to further on his career as he isn’t living up to his full potential. Charlie then asks about his goals, and Michael realizes he doesn’t have any goals. Charlie tells Michael about a major part of setting goals he learnt from Mr. Davis: writing them down. Charlie expands on this concept, saying that by writing down a goal, it means you have a goal in the first place, and that by writing the goal down, it brings it into reality. He continues by advising Michael to write down 100 things he wants to accomplish before death, and warns him that while the process is powerful, it is now more likely that he will achieve these goals as his mind is now aware of them, and will work towards achieving said goals. Charlie continues by mentioning another thing he learned, that a major reason behind setting a goal is what working towards said goal makes you as a person, which he says is a far greater value than the goal you set out to achieve. Michael then comes to the realization that the real goal is to allow the goal to make him a better person. Charlie also continues by saying that Michael should set 4 different goals; long range, mid-range, short-range and micro-goals, and that Michael should also decide what he wants to do and get started with it.</p>
    
    <p>In chapter 5, another lesson from Mr. Davis comes into play: we must all suffer from one of two pains, the pain of discipline or the pain of regret, saying that the pain of discipline weighs ounces, while the pain of regret weighs tons, to which Michael says he doesn’t understand. Charlie explains that there are some things in life that you long to do that if they aren’t achieved in your lifetime, you’ll regret deeply. He continues by saying that you should make sure to spend every day wisely, as when you spend a day, you will have one less day to spend, to which Michael asks how to tell if you’re spending a day wisely. Charlie says that Mr. Davis says a day well spent is one spent in the best way possible, and taking advantages of the best opportunities that align with your overall goals, which is what you should spend your time on. He asks Michael if that is how he spends his days, to which he says he only spends his days by getting by and getting paid to take care of bills. Charlie states that this is a trap most people get into, by spending time on the urgent instead of the important, and continues by saying it is better to be the master of your own time, instead of making time be the master of you. He also says to Michael that if he doesn’t design his own life plan, he will fall into someone else’s plan, and that person has nothing planned for him.</p>
    <p>In chapter 6, three weeks after their initial meet up, Michael goes to the Twelve Pillars to share an achievement with Charlie. Michael reveals to Charlie he has two pieces of good news, one of which being that he finally wrote down the 100 goals he has for his life. Michael explains what he wrote the 100 goals about, and Charlie asks how long it took and asks about some of the goals he wrote down. He then asks Charlie if he can teach him about the other pillars of success, to which Charlie happily agrees to. Charlie says to Michael that he should surround himself with successful people that live consistent to values and skills he wants to acquire and develop. He continues to say that the people in his life have the power to affect his destiny, and that he should question the effects they have on him. Charlie then asks Michael about his friends, then after Michael tells him about his 3 closest friends, Charlie suggest that he should make some adjustments to his friendships, as they aren’t a very good influence on him. He then continues by saying it is up to him to make the tough choice in order to protect himself from bad influences. Charlie continues by saying that every relationship is an association, and these either have a positive, neutral, or negative effect on a person. He also states that a successful person constantly determines the type of relationship and how to approach it. Charlie suggests that he should develop new relationships, and that successful people look for relationships with other successful people that help them to become better, to which Michael asks how he should do that. Charlie answers by implying that Michael should first develop himself personally in order to attract that type of person, and that the more successful he becomes, then the people he will be able to be in relations with will also be more successful than him. Charlie then continues and says the people he hangs around with will be a main factor in what his attitude becomes; if they don’t have a positive attitude, then they will stop him from being all he can be. He goes on and says he has never seen a successful person spending time with people with bad attitudes, only optimists and winners, after which, he explicitly states that we are the only people that can determine who we hang out with, and that this will have an impact on how your journey goes.</p>
    <p>In chapter 7, Charlie tells Michael about another pillar of success, which is about learning. He states that a successful person is a lifelong learner. Charlie then gets to the point, saying that self-education is the key to being successful in life, not necessarily formal education. He explains that self-education is what is learnt along the way of life so that you’re constantly growing. Charlie mentions that the truly successful people learn all their lives, to which Michael asks how they do so; Charlie replies by giving three answers, to read books, learn by observing successful people, and self-reflection to learn what went right or wrong. Michael is not too fond of the book idea, to which Charlie quotes Mr. Davis again, saying that it isn’t what a book costs, but it’s what it will cost if you don’t read the book. Charlie further sells the point of reading books by saying you open yourself to new ideas, and when these new ideas are applied, become our achievements and successes. Charlie then gives Michael the book titled The Magic of Thinking Big, as he leaves the Twelve Pillars. </p>

  <p>These chapters from the book have really opened my eyes and made me realize that I’ve been living my life rather complacently and not to the full extent that I should. I have many goals in life, but it only occurred to me around last month to also write some of these goals down, just like what Charlie told Michael to do. However, I’ve never put into thought 100 goals that I may want to achieve in my lifetime before death. While I was working on a specific goal I set for myself, even though I didn’t meet said goal, I realized that I was getting better at the skill I was practicing in order to get to this goal either way, which in the end will prove to be more valuable than that goal. As a result of seeing the results of that, and this book bringing it to my attention that the process is more valuable, I will be applying this concept to any other goal I set to achieve. </p>
    <p> In the following chapter, they discuss discipline and regret, something I have been struggling with my entire life. I have felt disciplined with some tasks, then I gradually get less interested, and wind up regretting that I didn’t pursue it for longer, but I intend to change that now as a result of the Twelve Pillars. Recently, I’ve only been spending my days focusing on classes and homework instead of honing my skills and chasing my goals, which could also lead to regret in the long run, so I will be managing my time wisely so I still have time to balance all of these. </p>
    <p>For chapter 6, Charlie convinces Michael to look into the group of close friends he has, and analyse if the relationship he has with them is worth keeping if he wants to successfully chase his goals. I have always looked into my close friends and wondered if the relationship I have with them is putting a positive or negative influence on my life, and luckily, they do. However, I have never considered starting relationships with other people that have the same goals I have in mind as I do, so that is something I’ll have to work on as well. </p>
    <p>In the final chapter we were to cover, Charlie tells Michael that self-education is the key to a successful life, which is what we learn as we go on with our lives. Of the three answers to the question of how to self-educate, I’ve only ever observed successful people and reflect on the results of decisions I’ve made; I shared the same view as Michael when it comes to books. Books have never really interested me since I believed I gain nothing of importance from them, most of the time they aren’t as interesting as other activities I engage in, and I also don’t have the time to read them fully. Seeing as books are valuable sources of information, and I’ll gain a lot more than I would if I didn’t read a particular book, then I’ll make the change and begin making the time to read at least 2 books a month. </p>
